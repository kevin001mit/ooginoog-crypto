{"date": "10:32 UTC", "mood": "Market is analyzing data...", "verdict": "WATCH", "reason": "Bitcoin's long-term rally is highlighted as 'broken' until it reclaims the $85,000 level, indicating significant overhead resistance and a period of selling pressure. Negative sentiment is reinforced by Coinbase's Q4 earnings miss and subsequent price target cuts from Wall Street analysts, suggesting broader weakness in the crypto market's corporate health and transaction volumes. While the appointment of crypto executives to the U.S. CFTC advisory group is a long-term positive for regulatory clarity and legitimacy, it does not immediately counteract the immediate bearish technical and fundamental signals. Investors should exercise caution and monitor for a clearer market direction.", "headlines": ["Bitcoin\u2019s long-term rally is \u2018broken\u2019 until it reclaims $85,000, Deribit executive says", "Wall Street analysts cut Coinbase price targets following Q4 earnings miss", "Recapping Consensus Hong Kong", "Crypto execs Armstrong, Garlinghouse among many named to U.S. CFTC advisory group", "Coinbase misses Q4 estimates as transaction revenue falls below $1 billion"], "links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/13/bitcoin-s-long-term-rally-is-broken-until-it-reclaims-usd85-000-deribit-executive-says", "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/13/wall-street-analysts-cut-coinbase-price-targets-following-q4-earnings-miss", "https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/13/recapping-consensus-hong-kong", "https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2026/02/12/crypto-execs-armstrong-garlinghouse-among-many-named-to-u-s-cftc-advisory-group", "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/12/coinbase-misses-q4-estimates-as-transaction-revenue-falls-below-usd1-billion"]}
