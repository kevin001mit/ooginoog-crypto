Hong Kong's ongoing efforts to build up crypto regulations are a long-term positive for market legitimacy but do not mitigate these acute, present risks.", "headlines": ["Wall Street giant Apollo deepens crypto push with Morpho token deal", "Hong Kong is trying to build up its crypto regulations: State of Crypto", "Prediction markets vs. insider trading: Founders admit blockchain transparency is the only defense", "BlackRock's digital assets head: Leverage-driven volatility threatens bitcoin\u2019s narrative", "XRP outruns bitcoin, ether after investors piled into the recent crash"], "links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/15/wall-street-giant-apollo-deepens-crypto-push-with-morpho-token-deal", "https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2026/02/16/hong-kong-is-trying-to-build-up-its-crypto-regulations-state-of-crypto", "https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/13/prediction-markets-vs-insider-trading-founders-admit-blockchain-transparency-is-the-only-defense", "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/13/blackrock-s-head-of-digital-assets-warns-leverage-driven-volatility-risks-undermine-bitcoin-s-institutional-narrative", "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/15/xrp-is-outrunning-bitcoin-and-ether-after-investors-piled-into-the-recent-crash"]}
