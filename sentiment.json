{"date": "21:21 UTC", "mood": "Market is analyzing data...", "verdict": "WATCH", "reason": "Bitcoin is currently experiencing a significant markdown phase, indicated by 'tumbling' prices and the 'worst one-day drawdown since FTX blowup,' spiraling towards the critical $60,000 support level. The news of Strategy's substantial loss on its Bitcoin holdings underscores the current market pain.
